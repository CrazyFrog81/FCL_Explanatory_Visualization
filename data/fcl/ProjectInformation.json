As a result, the air temperature surrounding the air conditioning units progressively increases with every floor.<br><br>\r\nKent Vale is a housing estate for guests and visitor of National University of Singapore. There are three high-rise buildings in Kent Vale: Blocks E, F and G. Each of these blocks has twenty-four levels, where the first four levels are void decks.

This residential project contains about 1,072 flat units in one continuous 15-storey block, embracing two huge raised courtyards. Public spaces and greenery are situated on the ground along the Punggol Walk, the raised courtyards (environment-decks), and roofs. Some parts of the roofs are used to places solar panels. The car-parking of the project is organized under the environment-decks. <br> <br>\r\n\r\nOur research team observed people\u2019s behaviours and activities in the spaces on various levels, interviewed people\u2019s space use preferences, quantified plant species, and measured the outdoor thermal comfort of the spaces in the project. <br>","polyinfo":"1,7,1.4090905518259738,103.89914274215698,1.4078249316654154,103.89847755432129,1.4068167252831114,103.90102028846741,1.4077820292750436,103.90146017074585,1.4083933882632442,103.90080571174622,1.4086829793069395,103.90021562576294,1.4090154726830952,103.89929294586182","files":"resources\/IMG_6235copy.jpg","is_deleted":"0"},{"id":"109","name":"Green Corridor","project":"<a href=\"http://www.fcl.ethz.ch/module/ecosystem-services-in-urban-landscapes/\">Ecosystem Services in Urban Landscapes<\/a>","contact":"<a href=\"mailto:richards@arch.ethz.ch\">Daniel Richards<\/a>","description":"The Green Corridor is the site of the railway which once connected central Singapore to Malaysia. The railway was decommissioned in 2011, and the land was converted into an informal track for walking and cycling recreation. A range of spontaneous vegetation types have sprung up in the corridor since it was decommissioned, and the site now provides a home for bird, snake, and reptile species, amongst others. There are currently moves to redevelop the green corridor, and the Ecosystem Services in Urban Landscapes project aims to inform future designs. The project will develop a toolbox that uses field and remotely-sensed data to predict the ecological performance of different design scenarios. Particular ecosystem services that are of interest include the cooling effect provided by vegetation, the impact of vegetation in reducing flood risk, and opportunities for

most important agricultural base, and also a quickly expanding urban agglomeration in China’s hinterland. Due to its strategic location, in recent years, especially since mid-2000s, the Chengdu plain received great investment and policy incentives from the national government It was also assigned as an experimental field for urban-rural transformation. The experiment mainly focuses on the concentration of land, in pursuit of higher efficiency in real estate, agricultural and industrial development. The key questions of this research are: What are the real social, economic and ecological impacts of the urban-rural transformation campaigns in Chengdu, what is the decisive forces for the transformation, how different stakeholders interacted with each other, and what may be the potential policy design and planning strategies in the future?","polyinfo":"1,42,31.04516845598997,103.6145041456945,30.97915774388235,103.6071294787774,30.89528260614476,103.6284723023226,30.84691369095162,103.6616595733569,30.74317563309842,103.6920550225161,30.63108470036653,103.5732045574349,30.62831685993901,103.5730587524304,30.59038357839876,103.5483877256316,30.551052565129,103.4847405876014,30.51261837568159,103.4729730038347,30.4158866799063,103.5390018640978,30.37791780057015,103.5923083471911,30.34629564350088,103.6231675411518,30.31870302887537,103.6963366960484,30.25479135826678,103.6995503177437,30.05515614577376,103.6920625817796,29.96450562626053,103.7420443470082,29.97217337626794,103.8392228671408,30.06477188747851,103.9635985892198,30.17252927829064,104.0469442980175,30.20999235714299,104.0812372374031,30.28900786779483,104.1146226101826,30.40746068048181,104.1985774450683,30.52972498385397,104.2538522464009,30.54076654813488,104.2544779065704,30.6119985957597,104.2713911694976,30.68405233149106,104.2689085768371,30.74951102950294,104.2918781203944,30.781556075918,104.3840656915077,30.81629347631168,104.4764090943071,30.92301561758332,104.5050726299116,31.07421953051659,104.5330113203882,31.2446797414704,104.5038464381167,31.25317039805135,104.3744922744678,31.25097368740397,104.3613765416618,31.18130694985608,104.175679502384,31.17881296127177,104.1690502355097,31.15154024946014,104.0096962909242,31.14895841893036,104.0032282103138,31.12491273517212,103.7392069509864,31.11685625128997,103.6697724421375,31.04516845598997,103.6145041456945","files":"resources\/Chengdu.jpg","is_deleted":"0"}]
